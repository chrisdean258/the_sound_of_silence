# the_sound_of_silence
Smart city sound detection 


The goal of the_sound_of_silence is to monitor sound throughout a city. The user of the system will strategically place several hardware devices (consisting of a sound sensor, arduino, and a raspberry pi) around a city or area. This will collect and process sound, sending the data to a server. From here the data is formatted and uploaded to the internet.
